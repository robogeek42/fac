A Factory game for the Agon.

So far:
- Simplified scrollable map.
- Terrain feaures (e.g. Treesm Rocks, Ores)
- Belts.
- Items that can be moved by belts.
- Inventory

To add:
- Machine functionality
- Movements from/to belts/machines
- Mining/Forestry

And that is before any overt optimisation, although I can't help myself
